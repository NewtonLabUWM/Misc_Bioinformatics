# Trimming primers from 16S rRNA gene sequences

## Check Python version

```
lou$ python --version
Python 3.8.6
```

Cutadapt [requires](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#dependencies) Python 3.6 or new. 


## Install Miniconda

Because [conda](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html) makes life easier.


## Install Cutadapt

Creating a [virtual environment](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) allows Cutadapt to access the Python versions and packages it depends on.

```
lou$ conda activate cutadaptenv
(cutadaptenv) lou$ 
(cutadaptenv) lou$ cutadapt --version
3.2
```
You can see the venv is activated when it is at the beginning of the new line.

Without the venv, Cutadapt commands will not work.

```
lou$ cutadapt --version
-bash: cutadapt: command not found
```




## Organize files
The following files should be in the same directory:
- FASTQ files
- cutadapt script
- FASTA with primer sequences (V4-V5 only)


## Execute script
1. Go to directory where your FASTQ files are stored

`(cutadaptenv) lou$ cd ~/path/to/directory`

2. Execute cutadapt script

`(cutadaptenv) lou$ sh cutadapt_script.sh`

## Interpret output

The output file will have text that looks something like this:

```
This is cutadapt 3.2 with Python 3.8.6
Command line parameters: -g CCAGCAGCYGCGGTAAN -G file:v4v5_revs.fasta -o cutadapt/SRR11487869_pass_1.fastq.gz -p cutadapt/SRR11487869_pass_2.fastq.gz SRR11487869_pass_1.fastq.gz SRR11487869_pass_2.fastq.gz

=== Summary ===

Total read pairs processed:            132,777

Total basepairs processed:    66,574,524 bp
  Read 1:    33,303,745 bp
  Read 2:    33,270,779 bp

=== First read: Adapter 1 ===

Sequence: CCAGCAGCYGCGGTAAN; Type: regular 5'; Length: 17; Trimmed: 130937 times

No. of allowed errors:
1-9 bp: 0; 10-16 bp: 1

Overview of removed sequences
length	count	expect	max.err	error counts
3	3	2074.6	0	3
11	2	0.0	1	0 2
```
etc...

Which shows that the forward primer was trimmed from 130,937 reads, out of 132,777 total reads in this file.
