Navigating common challenges in microbial ecology.

### ./Cutadapt
How to trim primer sequences from 16S rRNA gene reads generated by Illumina. We currently have code for [V4](https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej20128) and [V4-V5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2909393/) 16S rRNA gene regions.


### ./DADA2
<b>filterAndTrim_bigData.R -</b> At the [filter and trim step](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html), process groups of samples one at a time instead of all samples simultaneously. Saves time and computer power and crashes and headaches.


### catFASTQ.sh
Concatenate FASTQ files with identical names. Its original purpose was to combine files from two sequencing runs (on full and nano Illumina flow cells) on the same samples. 


### Demultiplex_fastq.sh
Trim primers and sort reads according to their unique adapter sequences. [Mothur](https://mothur.org/wiki/make.contigs/) has this ability, however it also merges paired-end reads in the process. Its original purpose was to sort reads from mutiple isolate 16S rRNA genes, sequenced simultaneously, based on their unique barcodes on the 5' ends of primers. This will be updated so it will take a list of file names as input.


### download_multiple_SRA
Download multiple files from NCBI [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). It's currently designed to download files with names that contain a series of numbers, which is typical for BioProjects (e.g., runs in project PRJNA597057 range from SRR10755563 to SRR10755886). This will be updated so it will take a list of run names as input.
