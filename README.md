### Cutadapt
How to trim primer sequences from 16S rRNA gene reads generated by Illumina.


### catFASTQ.sh
Concatenate FASTQ files with identical names. Its original purpose was to combine files from two sequencing runs (on full and nano Illumina flow cells) on the same samples. 


### Demultiplex_fastq.sh
Trim primers and sort reads according to their unique adapter sequences. [Mothur](https://mothur.org/wiki/make.contigs/) has this ability, however it also merges paired-end reads in the process. Its original purpose was to sort reads from mutiple 16S rRNA genes from cultures, sequenced simultaneously, based on their unique barcodes on the 5' ends of primers.
